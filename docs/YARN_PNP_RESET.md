# Resetting Yarn Plug'n'Play Environment

When encountering issues where executables such as `webpack` cannot be resolved in a Yarn Plug'n'Play (PnP) environment, reset the cached dependency metadata.

1. Delete the Yarn cache directory and install state archive:
   ```sh
   rm -rf .yarn/cache .yarn/install-state.gz
   ```
2. Remove the PnP loader file that records the module map:
   ```sh
   rm -f .pnp.cjs .pnp.loader.mjs
   ```
3. Reinstall dependencies so Yarn rebuilds its internal map:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

These steps force Yarn to refetch dependencies and recreate the binary map, resolving missing command mappings.
